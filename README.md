<p>
Parking Management is a form of car parking system that allows for the simplification of vehicle parking and flow management within site or locations.
This software can be implemented by companies to manage their traffic, create a safer and more efficient car park, optimise parking spaces, and add a new layer to your security.
</p>

<p>
The application provides to book parking spaces. There are three types, separated into 3 zones: ordinary, disabled people and employee. Employee parking spaces can be reserved only by users who register with the company's email. The application does not allow to book with one account several parking slots at the same time. When attempting to make a reservation, an error will be returned. If the process of reservation is successful, the notification with saving button will be show on screen. After pressing the button, a pdf version of ticket will be generated.
